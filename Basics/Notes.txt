Data Types

(Primitive Data Types)

char --  2 Byte

byte --  (-128 to 128)

int  --  4 Bytes (-10^9 to 10^9)

long --  8 Bytes (-10^18 to 10^18)

boolean -- true / false

float --> same as int in decimal form

double --> same as long in decimal form


int a = 20;
int b = a;

sout(a , b); --> 20 20

a = 40;

sout(a , b); --> 40 20

reason : Deep Copy


(Reference Data Type)

Char
Integer
Float
Long
Double 
Boolean 

Array 

Class is a blueprint

Point p1 = new Point(2,3);

Point p2 = p1;

sout(p1 , p2); --> 2,3 2,3

p1.x = 3;
p1.y = 4;

sout(p1 , p2) --> 3,4 3,4

Reason : Shallow Copy


Shallow Copy --> Deep Copy

Point p1 = new Point(2,3);

Point p2 = new Point(p1.x,p2.y);

scout(p1 , p2)  --> 2,3 2,3

p1.x = 3;
p1.y = 4;

scout(p1 ,p2) --> 3,4 2,3



Day 1 - (PPP)

Arrays -- It is a data structure which is a collection of elements each having indices which are used to access them manipulate them. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Dynamic Arrays --> They don't have any fixed size their size expands based on the elements being added and removed in runtime

In java if an array has a fixed size you can't add elements more than the size of the array , if so ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs
